# Static Deployment on Surge

A simple starter to host static sites on Surge.sh ðŸŒˆ 

Surge allows us to publish web apps to a CDN with a single command and no setup required. You need to create an account and get your token so that you can use github actions for deploying. Surge is a npm package which acts as a CLI. So make sure you have Node and npm installed on your system.

```
npm install -g surge
surge login 
surge token
```
